It is possible to add only one church per email account; <br/>
Each cell can have only one leader. <br/>
Each leader has access only to his cell and to his reports. <br/>
The name, e-mail and telephone number of the leaders can be seen by all users of the same church in order to promote integration among members. <br/>
Reports can be listed by name, date, time, letter combination. <br/>
The pastor's app can view all reports from all cells. <br/> <br/> <br/>

<font size='16' color='green'><b>Understanding usage:</b></font><br/><br/>

The first thing to do is to create a church.<br/>
Then you create a cell.<br/>
Then, without creating a leader for the cell.<br/>
Then later create the reports.<br/><br/><br/>

<font size='16' color='green'><b>Adding church<br/></b></font><br/><br/>

1° Click on the church icon or go to the top right menu.<br/>

<font size='16' color='red'><b>Obs .: Very important !!</b></font><br/><br/>

When adding the church, pay attention to the name you entered as it will not be possible to change it later. <br/>
If you want to change the name of the church you will have to delete it and do it again, but that would delete everything you included in that church. <br/>
When you delete the church, you will also delete the cells, the leaders and all the reports of all the cells will also be deleted. <br/>
So consider NOT DELETING THE CHURCH. <br/> <br/> <br/>
